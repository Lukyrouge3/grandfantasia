The tracking of MP will be interrupted shortly after the power of Erosion flows into the fault. Based on feedback, the power of Erosion goes to a place we cannot trace after entering the fault."

Later, the people sent into the northern region did not find any signs left by those members, nor did they find any flow of power."

$7$ "The difference between its isolation effect on MP and on people is significant. Therefore, the people we sent to the northern region, those who received the blessings of the gods and the secret methods, had all their abilities disabled and their connection with the gods was cut off."
