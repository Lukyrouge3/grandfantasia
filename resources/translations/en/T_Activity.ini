20|Envy's Herald|Thursday|15:00|Herald in Southern Island! Doppelgangers are here!|Tarot King Reigns Over the World!

Legend has it that the ancient Sprite Messengers of the parallel world had their souls continuously condensed by Taro for thousands of years, eventually manifesting into the form of the Tarot King and falling into an endless slumber. Now, due to the collapse of the parallel world, the resulting space-time distortions have created fissures, disturbing the slumbering Tarot King. The awakened Tarot King has decided to descend upon the world, bringing with him unforeseeable disasters.

The awakening of the Tarot King is an unknown calamity for the continent of Saphael. For the safety of the Saphael World, we ask all Sprite Messengers to defeat the Tarot King!

In the Easter atmosphere-filled Kaslow, the joyful laughter of children can be heard from time to time. It should have been a beautiful holiday, but on the day the Flying Rabbit King appeared, everything fell into chaos. The Flying Rabbit King, who desired to rule over time and space, used Kaslow's Fear as energy to cast a curse on the drifting Phoenix in the space-time, intending to make it a member of the Flying Rabbit Kingdom. Under the influence of the curse, Phoenix gradually weakened and could only stay in Kaslow.

Facing the attack of the Flying Rabbit King, the Kaslow Praetorian Guard was also at a loss, not knowing what to do, and the joyful celebration was interrupted. At this moment, a mysterious little red dragon suddenly appeared in the city, its appearance contrasting with everything in the city. When it saw someone approaching, it showed a fierce look, but occasionally revealed an expression of waiting. In order to solve the chaos caused by the appearance of the Flying Rabbit King, the Sprite Messengers began to try to communicate with the red dragon and find a way to restore Phoenix's power and repel the Flying Rabbit King.
